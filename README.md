# TODO-LIST-

This project implements a simple console-based To-Do List application in Java. Users can add, view, and delete tasks from their to-do list using a menu-driven interface.

Features :                                          
Add Task: Input and add a new task to the list.                                 
View Tasks: Display all tasks currently in the list.                                
Delete Task: Remove a task from the list based on its number.                            
Exit: Exit the application. 


How It Works :                                                       
The application operates in a loop, presenting a menu with options to manage the to-do list. Users can select an option by entering the corresponding number.
